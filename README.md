# livestream-notebook

The notebook in this repository takes as input a URL to a live audio stream and your Deepgram API Key (signup [here](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?utm_source=youtube) to receive one). The output will be real-time subtitles of the audio.

By default, the starter code is set up to provide English subtitles for BBC Radio's 24-hour livestream.
